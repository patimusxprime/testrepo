Here is a list of things that ill be practicing.. it would be a cool exercise if we clone this, work on it and whatever, then pull it back into the master repo. If it works the way i think it should, itll just add what we wrote at the bottom of this document and boom!


Git Commands:
commit
add
merge
branches
push
clone
cherry picks
repo syncs


Shell Commands:
installing software
